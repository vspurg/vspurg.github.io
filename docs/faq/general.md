## Air sortie with two decks

Q. If we are playing with two Command Card decks for Breakthrough battles, how many Air Sortie cards are used in a scenario like Breakthrough at Mortain?
A. Only use two Air Sorties and give both to the Allied player for that battle.

Q. If we’re playing with two Command Decks as suggested for the Breakthrough format, how many Air Sortie cards should we use in games with Air Rules (or Air Rules as optional)?
A. The number of Air Sortie cards we use in any scenario is a max of two. This is a good rule of thumb.

Q. If we’re playing with two Command Card decks but a scenario that has Air Rules as optional says to give one Air Sortie to each player, how many Air Sortie cards are used?
A. Use only two Air Sorties and give one to each player.

## Breakthrough Deck
Q. Does an On the Move card allow my chosen unit to battle, recover figures, Strafe, etc.?
A. No, On the Move only allows a unit to move; the unit can do no other actions.

Q. If a unit receives an On the Move order from a Breakthrough card, is that an ordered unit or just a ‘moved’ unit? That is, can the unit benefit from a Combat Card that ‘ordered’ units benefit from (such as Reposition)?
A. On the Move orders are exactly like every other order except that those units cannot battle. Combat Cards can be played on units that were activated with On the Move orders.

Q. Can On the Move orders be used for the Paradrop action?
A. Yes

Q. How many units can I activate using the new Medics & Mechanics card in the Breakthrough deck?
A. Per the rules on p. 6 in the Winter Wars booklet, the Breakthrough Medics & Mechanics card now allows multiple units across the battlefield to recover figures. An Infantry symbol rolled recovers one Infantry figure in any Infantry unit and an Armor symbol rolled recovers one tank figure in any Armor unit across the battlefield; a Star roll recovers a figure of your choice in any unit across the battlefield. Each unit that recovers at least one figure may be ordered.

Q. Is it OK for the authors of new scenarios created using the Memoir ʼ44 Scenario Editor to use the product of that editor on other web sites? In most cases, this would mean saving the print version as an MS Word document or a PDF file.
A. Absolutely, that’s fine. In as much as possible, we will try and be open regarding the game and welcome the community’s contributions, regardless of where they publish those (or which tool they use to do so, for that matter). Of course, this does not mean (like I read somewhere; on BGG maybe?) that the game itself is “Open Source” or that we won’t defend the game’s copyrights, trademarks and other rights. But the more open we can be, the better the game will be, we believe.

## Dealing Cards
Q. Before we start the game, how should we deal the cards to each side?
A. As long as you deal the cards in a random order, it doesn’t really matter. Richard Borg’s group deals the cards by dealing out a number of card piles (four, maybe five) equal to the max number of cards either player should have. Each player then selects a pile starting with the player who moves first in the scenario. If there are too many cards in the pile compared to the number listed for that player in the scenario, discard random cards to get down to the proper number, before looking at the cards. Place the unselected card piles back in the deck and shufﬂe the deck before starting play.

## Desert Terrain
Q. Is Desert terrain different from Beach, even though they look similar?
A. Yes. Desert should be played like countryside open terrain. Note: On a winter board, snow hexes should be played like countryside open terrain.

## Dice Questions
Q. What happens if there are dice conﬂicts?
A. In case of conﬂicts between the rules of the attacker and the defender in the interpretation of a Star result on the attacker’s dice, it is the attacker’s interpretation that prevails.
Examples:
» A Sniper attacking another Sniper hits on a Grenade or a Star (overriding the defending Sniper rule that states he’s only hit on a Grenade).
» An air attack on a Sniper hits on a Grenade or a Star for the same reasons as above.
» An air attack on a Plane that is on the ground is hit on a Grenade, a Star, or a Flag (overriding the rule that states that a Plane on the ground is only hit on a Grenade; remember that a Plane on the ground can’t retreat so a Flag becomes a hit).

Q. If a player wants to roll less Battle dice than he is allowed to, for strategic reasons, could he?
A. No. Players must roll the full number of Battle dice based on the attacking unit’s range and any combat modifiers in effect.

## Ending The Game
Q. When is the game officially over?
A. Battles are over the instant one side captures the required number of medals as established in the Conditions of Victory section of the scenario. Players do not get to finish their turn; they cannot do Armor Overrun or Take Ground. Note: Campaign Book Volume 2 introduces Position Control rules for campaigns battles, where players may choose to capture an objective hex instead of taking the eliminated unit as a medal. This rule is found on page 12 of CB #2.

Q. If you capture a multi-point objective at the end of the game, is it possible to get more than the needed medal count?
A. No. In a scenario where a set number of medals is listed as the Conditions of Victory, the game will end when the Conditions of Victory number is achieved. Sorry, there is no gravy!

Q. If a scenario can’t be won until I capture a specific objective, can I increase my final medal count by destroying other units before I capture the objective?
A. No. Like the answer about the multi-point objective, you cannot pad your score. For score-keeping purposes you will only receive the number of medals outlined in the conditions of victory section if you win.

## Line Of Sight
Q. Is there Line of Sight off the side of the board through the half hexes?
A. No.

## Night Visibility Chart
Q. The text at level six of the Night Visibility Chart is at odds with the graphic and other text at the bottom of the card which states “All units are subject to this limitation on their firing range”. It would be
much clearer if level six simply stated “Visibility Unlimited” in big letters, and dispensed with the hex graphic.
A. Good point. At level six, visibility is indeed unlimited.

## Retreating
Q. My opponent has rolled two Flags against my unit in Close Assault. May I choose a retreat path that limits my retreat to one hex and then just lose a figure so I can be closer for a counterattack on my next turn?
A. No. You have to retreat as far as you possibly could (in other words, evaluate all the Flags rolled at once, and pick any of the retreat paths that give you the MOST retreat hexes). Basically you may not “choose” to lose a figure if there is a clear path of retreat available to you that will fulfill all the Flags your opponent has tossed.

Q. If Exit rules are in effect and my opponent forces me to retreat while my unit is on an Exit hex, may I retreat off the board and get a medal?
A. No, the intent has always been that units must be ordered and then move off the battlefield via an Exit hex. You may not retreat off the board and gain an Exit medal.

Q. Is it possible to score a medal by retreating?
A. Yes, if your opponent forces your unit to retreat and you retreat onto an objective medal hex, it is possible to capture that medal during your retreat. Note: Units that retreat onto a Frozen River could score a medal if a hit is rolled.

Q. If I roll a Flag against a Tiger tank and it is unable to retreat, is it destroyed?
A. If a Tiger tank is forced to retreat, like any other unit that cannot retreat, one hit is scored for each retreat hex it cannot complete. However, these hits must be re-rolled and only a Grenade counts as a hit on the re-roll.

Q. If a Unit with a Heroic Leader is behind Sandbags, may that unit ignore two Flags thrown against it in a single battle?
A. Yes, this unit could ignore the 1st Flag because of the Sandbag (Terrain Protection) and the 2nd Flag because of Heroic Leader (Special Unit Protection). This same effect would also apply to Italian Artillery Units and Imperial Japanese units. However, if attacked by a Barrage or Airpower card, the unit would not be able to ignore any Flag because those cards always overpower the protections.

Q. Can a unit retreat onto a Fordable River hex, and if a unit is already in a Fordable River, can it retreat out of the hex?
A. Yes, a unit can retreat into and out of a Fordable River hex.

## Take Ground
Q. Can a unit Take Ground beyond its normal movement capacity (i.e. Infantry Special Forces unit moves two, Close Assault, destroys enemy unit, Takes Ground; making a move of three hexes)?
A. Yes. Special movements like Take Ground and Armor Overrun take place during Step 4 - Battle, and are in addition to the unit’s normal movement.

Q. Can an Armor unit move three hexes, Close Assault, destroy the enemy unit and Armor Overrun, force a retreat of a different unit in Close Assault and move another hex, but not battle, for a total of five hexes moved in one turn?
A. Yes, but the battle and movement restrictions for any terrain hexes entered will still apply.

Q. Can an Armor unit move two hexes on the Beach, have a successful Close Assault and Armor Overrun, to move three hexes?
A. Yes, an Armor unit could do that. Look in the book or on the summary card for Beaches: “Battle: No combat restrictions. A unit may still Take Ground after a successful Close Assault Combat.” The second sentence here shows that Armor could move two hexes on a Beach and Take Ground for one extra hex of movement.

Q. Can an Armor unit on an open terrain hex that has Close Assaulted an enemy unit on a Steep Hill Take Ground and Armor Overrun if that enemy unit is eliminated or retreats (even though movement up a Steep Hill is a two-hex move)?
A. Yes. Taking Ground up a Steep Hill is possible. An Armor unit may Take Ground and then do an Armor Overrun attack.

Q. May an Armor unit after a successful Close Assault on an enemy in a Forest, Town or Hedgerow perform an Armor Overrun by Taking Ground and attacking again, or does the terrain battle restriction prevent that?
A. An Armor unit could Take Ground into these terrain hexes, but the terrain would prevent it from battling. Any terrain that does not allow battling the same turn it is entered would play the same. Note: Hedgerows can only be entered with Take Ground or Armor Overrun if the unit started the turn adjacent to the Hedgerow hex.

Q. May an Armor unit after a successful Close Assault on an enemy in Wire perform an Armor Overrun by Taking Ground and attacking again?
A. Yes. An Armor unit that makes a successful Close Assault on an enemy unit on a Wire hex may Armor Overrun and battle.


The Wire is removed. If the Overrun is successful, the Armor may not Take Ground because Wire states that units may not move further that turn, which includes Taking Ground.

Q. May an Armor unit after a successful Close Assault on an enemy in a Bunker perform an Armor Overrun by Taking Ground and attacking again, or does the terrain battle restriction prevent that?
A. An Armor unit that makes a successful Close Assault on a unit in a Bunker hex may not Take Ground because Armor cannot enter a Bunker hex, which means the Armor cannot battle since it didn’t Take Ground. Note: As stated in the Equipment Pack rules, page 4, Petard Mortar units may be an exception because they can destroy Bunkers.

Q. If an Infantry unit moves onto Wire (which stops movement) and makes a successful Close Assault, can the Infantry unit Take Ground?
A. No. An Infantry unit that enters a hex with Wire must stop and may move no further on that turn. It may not Take Ground after a successful Close Assault when it enters Wire. Note: Armor cannot Take Ground or Armor Overrun, either.

Q. Under North Africa rules, if an Armor unit destroys an enemy unit in a Town or Palm Forest, can it Take Ground into that hex and then come out to do a Desert Overrun attack? Or must it stop moving after it Takes Ground?
A. The Palm Forest hex has the same terrain effect as a Forest; therefore a unit that enters a Palm Forest hex must stop and may move no further on that turn. Also, note that a unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Palm Forest (or Forest) hex. The Desert Town & Village hex has the same terrain effect as Towns & Villages from the base game; therefore a unit that enters a Town hex must stop and may move no further on that turn. As with all Town hexes, a unit may not battle the turn it moves onto the hex.
## Temporary Medals
Q. The rules say that a temporary majority objective requires a player to have units in an absolute majority of the specified hexes. Does that mean at least half of the specified hexes, of simply more hexes than your opponent?
A. The medal is TEMPORARY in that you can gain and lose it during play and to have a MAJORITY means to simply occupy one more objective hex than your opponent. Sorry for any confusion caused by the “absolute majority” wording.
## Unusable Cards Situation
Q. When a player cannot play any of his Command Cards (because he does not have any units in the appropriate section), does he discard a card and order
no units this turn?
A. Yes. You may play a section card for a section where you do not have any units. No units are ordered, and you will not do anything but discard and draw another card.
## Vehicles
Q: Which units are considered Vehicles in Memoir ‘44?
A: Vehicles are Armor units (including Hobart’s Funnies, Tigers, and Tank Destroyers), Patrol Cars, Command Cars, Half-Tracks, and Supply Trucks. The following are not considered Vehicles: Artillery (including Mobile Artillery), Trains, Landing Craft, Aircraft Carriers, Destroyers, Airplanes, and Cavalry.
## Winter Wars
Q. In playing Winter Wars scenarios with Reduced Visibility rules, do Tank Destroyers still get hit with Stars by non-Infantry units firing from a distance?
A. Yes, a Tank Destroyer unit follows the standard rules for scoring hits against it when playing Winter Wars scenarios with Reduced Visibility rules.
